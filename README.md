# Prediction of Surface Temperature in Continuous Casting of Steel Using Artificial Neural Networks
This project includes the supplementary python code for my Bachelor's thesis about the predicition of the surface temperature in the continouus casting of stell using artificial networks such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs).
